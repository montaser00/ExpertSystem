Societies often categorize people into different economic classes based on wealth, income, and access to resources. While the specific definitions of these classes may vary by country and economic context, the general classification includes:

### 1. **Upper Class (Wealthy/Elite)**
- **Defining Characteristics**: The upper class typically possesses significant wealth, often inherited or earned through high-income professions, business ownership, or investments. This group has access to abundant resources and enjoys a high standard of living.
- **Income Source**: This class often derives income from capital gains, business ownership, dividends, real estate investments, and other passive income sources.
- **Lifestyle**: The upper class can afford luxury goods, exclusive education, private healthcare, and prestigious lifestyles. They have significant influence over politics, economics, and culture.
- **Example**: CEOs, billionaires, heirs to large fortunes, and influential business moguls.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Wealth in the millions to billions of dollars.

### 2. **Upper-Middle Class**
- **Defining Characteristics**: This group is characterized by high educational attainment and professional occupations. They are often in managerial, executive, or specialized roles and enjoy a comfortable and stable financial life.
- **Income Source**: Salaries from high-paying jobs, business income, investments, or a combination of these.
- **Lifestyle**: The upper-middle class typically enjoys a comfortable standard of living, including homeownership in affluent areas, access to quality healthcare, and the ability to save for retirement, children’s education, and vacations.
- **Example**: Doctors, lawyers, senior executives, successful entrepreneurs, and well-compensated professionals.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Wealth can range from a few hundred thousand dollars to several million.

### 3. **Middle Class**
- **Defining Characteristics**: The middle class includes individuals and families with stable jobs, moderate incomes, and the ability to afford basic needs and some luxuries. They prioritize education, homeownership, and long-term savings.
- **Income Source**: Salaries from stable jobs, small business income, and, sometimes, moderate investments.
- **Lifestyle**: They usually own homes, have access to healthcare, and can afford education and vacations, though not extravagantly. Financial stability is a goal, but some may still live paycheck to paycheck.
- **Example**: Teachers, nurses, office workers, small business owners, and skilled tradespeople.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Wealth varies significantly but typically includes a home, savings, and some investments, ranging from tens of thousands to several hundred thousand dollars.

### 4. **Lower-Middle Class**
- **Defining Characteristics**: This group lives a relatively stable life but has fewer financial resources and less security than the middle class. They may have jobs that provide just enough for basic needs, with little left over for luxuries.
- **Income Source**: Salaries from blue-collar or lower-paying white-collar jobs, often without the safety net of investments or savings.
- **Lifestyle**: The lower-middle class can usually cover basic needs like housing, food, and education, but they may struggle to afford large expenses or save for the future. They might be vulnerable to economic downturns.
- **Example**: Administrative workers, retail managers, factory workers, or small-scale service providers.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Minimal wealth, often consisting of modest savings or retirement funds, with little to no investments.

### 5. **Working Class**
- **Defining Characteristics**: The working class generally has lower levels of education and works in jobs that require manual labor or routine tasks. They may face financial instability and live paycheck to paycheck.
- **Income Source**: Hourly wages or low-paying jobs in industries like retail, manufacturing, and service.
- **Lifestyle**: The working class can often meet their basic needs, but they have little to no savings and may struggle to cover unexpected expenses. Homeownership may be difficult, and they are more likely to rent housing.
- **Example**: Construction workers, factory workers, restaurant staff, and delivery drivers.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Minimal wealth, with many people in this class having little savings and relying on wages.

### 6. **Lower Class (Poor)**
- **Defining Characteristics**: This class is characterized by low income, unemployment, or underemployment. They often live in poverty and face significant financial insecurity.
- **Income Source**: Unstable jobs, government assistance, or low-wage work with little to no benefits.
- **Lifestyle**: People in the lower class often struggle to meet basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare. They are more vulnerable to crises and have little to no savings.
- **Example**: Minimum wage workers, unemployed individuals, or people relying on social safety nets.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Very little to no wealth, often living in debt or relying on government assistance.

### 7. **Underclass (Destitute)**
- **Defining Characteristics**: The underclass consists of individuals and families who live in extreme poverty and may be chronically unemployed, homeless, or heavily dependent on public assistance.
- **Income Source**: Little to no income, often relying on charity, government aid, or informal work.
- **Lifestyle**: They struggle with severe financial instability, often living without permanent housing, regular access to food, or healthcare.
- **Example**: Homeless individuals, people in long-term unemployment, or those facing extreme deprivation.
- **Estimated Wealth**: Virtually no wealth or negative wealth (debt).

### Additional Factors
- **Wealth Mobility**: People can move between classes based on changes in income, education, job opportunities, or unexpected financial windfalls or crises.
- **Cultural and Social Capital**: Social class isn’t solely determined by income. Education, family background, social networks, and cultural values also influence class status.
